  <!-- 
    ComposedEventChild Template
    
    This template provides a button to dispatch a composed custom event.
    The event will cross the Shadow DOM boundary and reach parent components.
  -->
  <div class="container">
    <h3>Child Component - Composed Event (composed: true)</h3>
    <p>This event CAN bubble through shadow DOM boundary</p>
    
    <!-- 
      Button to trigger the composed event dispatch
      - onclick={handleDispatchComposedEvent} binds the click event to the handler method
      - When clicked, it creates and dispatches a CustomEvent with composed: true
    -->
    <button onclick={handleDispatchComposedEvent}>
      Dispatch Composed Event
    </button>
    
    <!-- 
      Informational text explaining the behavior
      - Composed events (composed: true) can cross Shadow DOM boundaries
      - This allows parent components to listen and respond to this event
      - The event propagates up the component hierarchy to all ancestors
    -->
    <p class="info-text">
      When this button is clicked, the event will propagate to the parent component
      and beyond, even crossing shadow DOM boundaries.
